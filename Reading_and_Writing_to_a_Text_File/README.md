Challenges 105 - 110: Reading and Writing to a Text File (page 96)


### **numbers.txt.py (task 105)**
Write a new file called “Numbers.txt”. Add five numbers to the document which are stored on the same line and only separated by a comma. Once you have run the program, look in the location where your program is stored and you should see that the file has been created

### **names.txt.py (task 106)**
Create a new file called “Names.txt”. Add five names to the document, which are stored on separate lines. Once you have run the program, look in the location where your program is stored and check that the file has been created properly

### **read_names.py (task 107)**
Open the Names.txt file and display the data in Python

### **update_Names_txt.py (task 108)**
Open the Names.txt file. Ask the user to input a new name. Add this to the end of the file and display the entire file

### **subject_menu.py (task 109)**
Display the following menu to the user:
```
1) Create a new file
2) Display the file
3) Add a new item to the file
Make a selection: 1, 2 or 3:
```

Ask the user to enter 1, 2 or 3. If they select anything other than 1, 2 or 3 it should display a suitable error message. If they select 1, ask the user to enter a school subject and save it to a new file called “Subject.txt”. It should overwrite any existing file with a new file. If they select 2, display the contents of the “Subject.txt” file. If they select 3, ask the user to enter a new subject and save it to the file and then display the entire contents of the file. Run the program several times to test the options

### **names2_txt.py (task 110)**
Using the Names.txt file you created earlier, display the list of names in Python. Ask the user to type in one of the names and then save all the names except the one they entered into a new file called Names2.txt
