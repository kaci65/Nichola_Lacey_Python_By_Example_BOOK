Challenges 27 - 34: Math (page 39 - 40)


### **multiply.py (task 027)**
Ask the user to enter a number with lots of decimal places. Multiply this number by two and display the answer

### **update_multiply.py (task 028)**
Update program 027 so that it will display the answer to two decimal places

### **square_root.py (task 029)**
Ask the user to enter an integer that is over 500. Work out the square root of that number and display it to two decimal places

### **PI.py (task 030)**
Display pi (π) to five decimal places

### **circle.py (task 031)**
Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle (measurement from the centre point to the edge). Work out the area of the circle (π*radius^2)

### **cylinder.py (task 032)**
Ask for the radius and the depth of a cylinder and work out the total volume (circle area*depth) rounded to three decimal places

### **divide.py (task 033)**
Ask the user to enter two numbers. Use whole number division to divide the first number by the second and also work out the remainder and display the answer in a user-friendly way (e.g. if they enter 7 and 2 display “7 divided by 2 is 3 with 1 remaining”)

### **square_vs_triangle.py (task 034)**
Display the following message:
```
1) Square
2) Triangle

Enter a number:
```
If the user enters 1, then it should ask them for the length of one of its sides and display the area. If they select 2, it should ask for the base and height of the triangle and display the area. If they type in anything else, it should give them a suitable error message
