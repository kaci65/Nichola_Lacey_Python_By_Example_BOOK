# **Python by Example by Nichola Lacey**
Challenges 20 - 26: Strings (page 32 - 36)


### **name_length.py (task 020)**
Ask the user to enter their first name and then display the length of their name

### **concat_length.py (task 021)**
Ask the user to enter their first name and then ask them to enter their surname. Join them together with a space between and display the name and the length of whole name

### **title_case.py (task 022)**
Ask the user to enter their first name and surname in lower case. Change the case to title case and join them together. Display the finished result

### **rhyme_and_slice.py (task 023)**
Ask the user to type in the first line of a nursery rhyme and display the length of the string. Ask for a starting number and an ending number and then display just that section of the text (remember Python starts counting from 0 and not 1)

### **uppercase.py (task 024)**
Ask the user to type in any word and display it in upper case

### **upper_or_lower.py (task 025)**
Ask the user to enter their first name. If the length of their first name is under five characters, ask them to enter their surname and join them together (without a space) and display the name in upper case. If the length of the first name is five or more characters, display their first name in lower case

### **pig_latin.py (task 026)**
Pig Latin takes the first consonant of a word, moves it to the end of the word and adds on an “ay”. If a word begins with a vowel you just add “way” to the end. For example, pig becomes igpay, banana becomes ananabay, and aadvark becomes aadvarkway. Create a program that will ask the user to enter a word and change it into Pig Latin. Make sure the new word is displayed in lower case
